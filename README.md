### **I. Customer & Account Analysis**
## Task 1:Count of active accounts and total balance per customer
### [script; (Scripts/Task_1.sql)](Scripts/Task_1.sql)
### result:
<p align="center">
  <img src="Visualizations/active_customers_segmentation.png" width="45%">
  <img src="Visualizations/Active_accounts_total_balance.png" width="45%">
</p>

**Analysis Result:**                                      
Customers with only 1 account form the core customer base of the bank, both in terms of number and total balance.
## Task 2: Average balance and number of transactions by cities
### [script; (Scripts/Task_2.sql)](Scripts/Task_2.sql)
### result:
![chart 1](Visualizations/city_table.png)

**Analysis Result:**  
Sumqayit is the leader in customer activity and balance. Ganja and Lankaran maintain high balances, Sheki and Mingachevir excel in transaction activity, whereas Baku shows lower metrics in both aspects.
## Task 3: Account count and balance by customer age group
### [script; (Scripts/Task_3.sql)](Scripts/Task_3.sql)
### result:
![chart 1](Visualizations/age_table.png)

**Analysis Result:**      
Age groups 28-37 and 68-77 are above the average;   
Age groups 38-47 and 58-67 are below the average; 
## Task 4:Top 10 richest customers (by total balance)
### [script; (Scripts/Task_4.sql)](Scripts/Task_4.sql)
### result:
![chart 1](Visualizations/top10_customers.png)
## Task 5: Comparison of balances between active and closed accounts
### [script; (Scripts/Task_5.sql)](Scripts/Task_5.sql)
### result:
<p align="center">
  <img src="Visualizations/account_count.png" width="45%">
  <img src="Visualizations/balance_ratio.png" width="45%">
</p>

**AnalysisResult:**                                      
Approximately 60% of the total balance belongs to closed accounts. This indicates that a portion of previously high-balance customers are no longer active. The bank has lost higher-balance customers, which signals a customer retention issue.

## **Results & Recommendations:**  
1. Customers with 1 account
   - Offer extra products: deposit accounts, credit cards, investment products, insurance.
   - Goal: increase number of accounts.
2. Regional & premium strategy
   - Sumqayit: Special loyalty & premium service programs; test new products/campaigns here first.
   - Baku: Boost activity with cashback, bonuses, or commission-free transactions.
3. Age group strategy
   - 18-27: Starter accounts, educational products.
   - 28-37: High potential; special offers, investment products, premium services.
   - 38-47: Low balances/accounts; use promotions and loyalty programs.
4. Exclusive benefits
   - Personal manager, discounted fees, extra interest.
   - Offer additional products: investment products, insurance, premium cards.
5. Customer retention strategy
   - Investigate reasons for account closures (fees, interest, satisfaction).
   - Apply loyalty/bonus programs for active customers.
   - Re-engage high-balance closed-account customers with ‚Äúreturn bonuses.‚Äù
